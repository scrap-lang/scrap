Take a look at the "first" token outputted by the tokenizer, wow so magical.
```v
[Token{
    kind: let
    value: 'let'
    line: 0
    index: 0
}]
```


```v
[Token{
    kind: let
    value: 'let'
    line: 0
    index: 3
}, Token{
    kind: name
    value: 'foo'
    line: 0
    index: 7
}, Token{
    kind: assign
    value: '='
    line: 0
    index: 8
}, Token{
    kind: number
    value: '10'
    line: 0
    index: 12
}]
```
